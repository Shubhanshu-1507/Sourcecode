Problem: Merge Intervals
Description:
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Solution:
Sort the intervals by their start value. Then, iterate through the sorted list and merge overlapping intervals.

def merge_intervals(intervals: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    if not intervals:
        return []

    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = [intervals[0]]

    for current in intervals[1:]:
        last = merged[-1]
        if current[0] <= last[1]:  # overlap
            last[1] = max(last[1], current[1])
        else:
            merged.append(current)
    
    return merged

# Example:
intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
print(merge_intervals(intervals))  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
