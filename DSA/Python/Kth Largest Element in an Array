Problem: Kth Largest Element in an Array
Description:
Find the k-th largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the k-th largest element in sorted order, not the k-th distinct element.

Solution:
We can use a min-heap of size k. By the time we finish iterating through the array, the root of the heap will contain the k-th largest element.

import heapq

def find_kth_largest(nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
    heap = []
    
    for num in nums:
        heapq.heappush(heap, num)
        if len(heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(heap)
    
    return heap[0]

# Example:
nums = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4]
k = 2
print(find_kth_largest(nums, k))  # Output: 5
